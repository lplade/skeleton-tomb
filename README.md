Don't edit the html directly. Edit the Pug file, then run `pug -P index.pug`

Still sorting out CC credits for audio files. You can generate your own.

You need a longish (at least 15 min) ambient sound file and a sample saying "Arise and protect the tomb, skeletal guardians!" in the `audio_src` directory.
From the main directory, run `scripts/gen_audio.sh` and it sets up the necessary sound files.
