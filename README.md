# Skeleton Tomb
Soundboard for Skeletons RPG

Still sorting out CC credits for audio files. You can generate your own.

You need a longish (at least 15 min) ambient sound file and a sample saying "Arise and protect the tomb, skeletal guardians!" in the audio_src directory.
From the main directory, run scripts/gen_audio.sh and it sets up the necessary sound files.
